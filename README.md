# FDA Recall Search

FDA Recall Search is a web application that returns customized information about FDA recalls near you!

## Demo

Below is a video showing how to use the web application. On the home screen you see a map of the top 25 states with current food recalls along with top 4 categories in an interactive graph on the bottom of the screen. After the user enters search criteria then a new page is loaded and if there are results then the user can click on the recalling firm to load potential New York Times articles with similar search terms. Those article titles can be clicked on to view the New York Times article on their site.
